# how-to-dice-boost-monopoly-go-for-free
Monopoly Go is a reimagined version of the classic board game that's beloved around the world. The free-to-play app for Android and iOS mixes traditional elements of the almost 100 year-old game, like collecting property, building houses, and passing Go, with online multiplayer and mini-games.

To progress through Monopoly Go, you'll need plenty of Dice Rolls, which is a crucial in-game currency. Each time you want to move around the game's virtual board, you'll need to use up a Dice Roll. To get more dice, you'll have to take advantage of daily login bonuses, complete more of the game, and take part in events, among other things.

You can also spend real-life money to get more Dice, but if you'd rather not do that you can just use Monopoly Go Free Dice Links instead. Clicking on these links, which are shared each day on the app's official Instagram account, and sometimes on Facebook, will help you claim Dice Rolls entirely for free!
